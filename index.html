<!-- The story section is consist of two things. In order for those to be grid-items, each of the sides has to be a different element right?
and so we say that those two are part of a story, but that left side here is the pictures and that right side is the content. So each
of these will be a different grid-item. So we used story__pictures(so an element(and not a block) on the root of the html!!!), so we haven't first a
block which has a class named story and THEN, inside it, we have that .story__pictures. NO! In this case we don't do this
and it's perfectly legal to do it like this. So it's no problem having the block and the element(block__element) without having a parent block.
So we know that these two are part of the .story block, but there's not really an element for that, because we want both of these elements to BE
A GRID-ITEM, which being a grid-item in this case means to be a DIRECT child of <body class="container">, so we couldn't set another parent like
<section class="story"> for these two elements(which we usually had), that would block the effect of grid on these two.-->
