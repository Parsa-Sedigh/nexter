CSS grid layout module or in short, css grids.

2. Why css grid, a whole new mindset
A whole new mindset:
What are css grids?
-CSS grid layout is a brand new module that brings a two-dimensional grid system to CSS for the first time. The grids changes
 everything, like: how we think about layout, how we write our css and even how we write our markup in html.
-Css grids replaces float layouts, using less and more readable and logical css and html.
-Css grids works perfectly together with flexbox, which the flexbox is best to handle ONE-dimensional components and layouts.
-Css grids completely changes the way that we envision and build two-dimensional layouts.

CSS grid terminology:
        Css grids                                   flexbox                                         normal css
                                            (default axis with flex-direction: row)
        |-----------------> row axis                  ----------------> main axis                   ------------> x
        |                                             |                                             |
        |                                             |                                             |
        |                                             |                                             |
        |                                             |                                             |
    column axis                                   cross axis                                        y

display: grid;
(display: inline-grid;)
Just like we have a flex container in flexbox, in css grids, we have a grid container and we create a new grid container,
by setting the display prop of an element to grid. Then ALL of the DIRECT children of that grid container become the grid items.
The axes in grids are ALWAYS THE SAME and you CAN'T change where they are like what we do in flexbox.

The vertical and horizontal lines that divide up the grid and separate the columns and rows, are called the grid lines and they are
automatically numbered for the columns, as well as for the rows and those grid lines start from one, all the way to the number of rows plus
one and the number of columns of course. So if you have 3 columns and 2 rows, then you would have 4 grid lines vertically and 3 grid lines
horizontally.

The actual space that is between the rows and columns is called the gutter and the row gutter can be different from the column gutter.
What are the grid rows and columns actually?
Well, the space(without the gutter) between two grid lines is called a track, no matter if it's vertical or horizontal. If it's horizontal,
then it's called a row of course! and if it's(the track) vertical, then it's called a column.

The area between two vertical and two horizontal grid lines is called a grid line and if that area is between two adjacent grid lines and
two adjacent column lines, then that area is just called a grid cell.
